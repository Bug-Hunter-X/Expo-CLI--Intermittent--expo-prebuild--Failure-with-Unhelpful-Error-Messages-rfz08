# Expo CLI: Intermittent `expo prebuild` Failure

This repository demonstrates an intermittent issue encountered with the Expo CLI's `expo prebuild` command. The command fails randomly with vague error messages, making debugging difficult.  The problem is not consistently reproducible and solutions like cleaning the build are unreliable.

## Problem

The `expo prebuild` command occasionally fails, providing little to no information about the root cause of the failure. The error message is inconsistent and does not pinpoint the specific problem. The failure occurs even with no changes to the project code.

## Solution

The proposed solution attempts to improve the error handling and provide more context, along with a workaround to potentially mitigate the issue.  While a definitive fix is not yet available, the solution aims to enhance debugging capabilities.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run `expo prebuild` repeatedly. Observe that sometimes it will succeed, other times it will fail with non-specific error messages.

## Note

The exact cause of this issue is still under investigation. The solution offered focuses on making the error messages more informative and providing a possible workaround.
