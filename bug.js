While using Expo CLI, I encountered an issue where the `expo prebuild` command would fail intermittently with a cryptic error message.  The error message didn't provide much detail about the root cause, making debugging difficult. The error would occur randomly, even when building the same project multiple times without code changes.  Sometimes a clean build would resolve the issue, but this wasn't a reliable fix.
